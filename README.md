| [DAWN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22652)| #mobile manipulation| DAWN is a novel framework for translating language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates high-level planning and low-level control into a unified diffusion process, operating within the pixel-motion space. The framework accepts language instructions (with optional visual context), generates a "pixel motion map," and converts it into robotic actions. This system has been deployed on the Galaxea **R1 Lite** platform. The pixel-based approach not only endows motion flows with interpretability but also enhances generalization across tasks.|
